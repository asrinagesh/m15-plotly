## Car Data

This is car data.

```{r cars}
data(cars)
a <- list(
  x = cars$speed,
  y = cars$dist,
  text = "Car Data",
  xref = "Speed",
  yref = "Distance",
  showarrow = TRUE,
  arrowhead = 7,
  ax = 20,
  ay = -40
)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(annotations = a)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
